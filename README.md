### You can create 3D models for your 3D printer from scratch through playing 3D Tetris! ###

First of all, just try this app:
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7988399/Threejs-Tetris-3DModeler/index.html

* I tested this app with Chrome on windows, Chrome and FireFox on Mac. It doesn't work with Safari on Mac, any browsers on Smartphones. (WHY?)
* .STL export function is available with pressing esc key , or a button on the top left of the screen anytime.
* You might need to repair .STL with https://modelrepair.azurewebsites.net/index.php

### Secret features ###
* Press space key to speed up the fall of each block.
* Press "c" key for cancel the current block.
* Press "1","2", and "3" keys to change modes. Easy, normal, and hard mode are available.
 * Easy mode: slow speed, and only I-shaped blocks appear.
 * Normal mode: medium speed.
 * Hard mode: high speed.
