### You can create 3D models for your 3D printer from scratch through playing 3D Tetris! ###

First of all, just try this app:
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7988399/Threejs-Tetris-3DModeler/index.html

* I tested this app with Chrome on windows, Chrome and FireFox on Mac. It doesn't work with Safari on Mac, any browsers on Smartphones. (WHY?)
* .STL export function is available with pressing esc key , or a button on the top left of the screen anytime.
* You might need to repair .STL with https://modelrepair.azurewebsites.net/index.php
* Push space key to speed up the fall of each block.

* Secret features 1: "1","2","3" keys for changing modes. Easy, normal, and hard mode are available.
* Secret features 2: Press "c" key for cancel the current block.
