### Secret features ###
* Press "c" key for cancel the current block.
* Press "1","2", and "3" keys to change modes. Easy, normal, and hard mode are available.
 * Easy mode: slow speed, and easy blocks only appear.
 * Normal mode: medium speed.
 * Hard mode: high speed. 

* I tested this app with Chrome and FireFox on Windows and Mac. It doesn't work with Safari on Mac, any browsers on Smartphones. (Maybe because of something related with WebGL)
* You might need to repair .STL with https://modelrepair.azurewebsites.net/index.php
