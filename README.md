### You can create 3D models for your 3D printer from scratch through playing 3D Tetris! ###

First of all, just try this app:
http://t3dm.azurewebsites.net/

### How to play ###
* Movement: arrows
* Rotation: AD/SW/QE
* Export model (.stl format): ESC key
* Speed up the fall of each block: SPACE key

### Secret features ###
* Press "c" key for cancel the current block.
* Press "1","2", and "3" keys to change modes. Easy, normal, and hard mode are available.
 * Easy mode: slow speed, and only I-shaped blocks appear.
 * Normal mode: medium speed.
 * Hard mode: high speed. 

* I tested this app with Chrome on windows, Chrome and FireFox on Mac. It doesn't work with Safari on Mac, any browsers on Smartphones. (WHY?)
* You might need to repair .STL with https://modelrepair.azurewebsites.net/index.php
